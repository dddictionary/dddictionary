My name is Abrar.

I live in New York City and study Computer Science.

My interests are all over the place, but I have a few ones that I really like.

- Programming languages
- Data Science
- Physics
- Open Source

Currently learning Rust ðŸ¦€

Most of my repositories are to hold personal files that I wanted to transfer from my PC to my laptop.
Other's are half completed projects that I abandoned after a while ðŸ˜…. One day when I'm more knowledgable, I will come back to finish those projects.
